# ClickableQuiz
A small learning plugin for Kotlin. Allows clickable quizzes in chat.

## "Disclaimer"
This plugin was written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) and mainly made for me to learn the language a bit better.

## Plugin Request
It was made after a Plugin Request on the Bukkit Forums [here](https://bukkit.org/threads/harry-potter-clickable-chat-quiz-plugin.434731/) though I changed it a bit.
